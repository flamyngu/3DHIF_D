Sorry for this barebone README file, I currently do not have the time to write a nicer Documentation. In the comming week I am going to post a better and more in depth documentation, until then this will have to do

So this project has been rejected, cause my readme is too barebone, so Ig will try to write a little instruction on how to use the webpage?
<br>
<br>
1. You will land on a login page, where you will be promoted to create an "account" consisting of a User name and a password. Those do not have to be backed by any emails or stuff like this, for they are just stored in local storage. 

2. After "logging in" you will be taken to the main page where you can choose the amount of questions, their category, their difficulty and if they are multiple choice or boolean. After selecting your desired trivia you can click on "Start Quiz".

3. Then you take the quiz, your highscore will be stored in local storage and later be used to be displayed on the leaderboard/highscores.html.

4. The above 3 points explained the general use of the trivia webpage, the following will illustrated the extra features: There is a High score page that you can filter by category. You can change the account to have another listing on the leaderboard.

I hope this is enough for know. As I already said at the beginning of this README.md I will be uploading a extended documentation next week.
